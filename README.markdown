##Overview

The ucarp module provides the installation procedure for UCARP including the setup of
the virtual IP.

##Module Description

The UCARP module provides a virtual IP that can be used in a cluster.

##Setup

###What ucarp affects

* ucarp package.
* ucarp configuration file.
* ucarp alternative service configuration.

###Beginning with ucarp

include '::ucarp' is enough to get you up and running if the parameters point to
proper values.  If you wish to pass in parameters like which servers to use then you
can use:

```puppet
class { '::ucarp':
  vId => '001',
  vIp => '192.168.0.222',
  vIpPrefixLength => '24',
  vIf => 'eth0',
  vPw => 'Secret'
}
```

##Usage

All interaction with the ucarp module can do be done through the main ucarp class.
This means you can simply toggle the options in the ucarp class to get at the full
functionality.

###I just want UCARP, what's the minimum I need?

```puppet
include '::ucarp'
```

##Limitations

This module has been built on and tested against Puppet 3.2 and higher.

The module has been tested on:

* RedHat Enterprise Linux 6
* Scientific Linux 6
* Gentoo Linux

Testing on other platforms has been light and cannot be guaranteed.

Currently only eth0 is supported, using other interfaces result in a rewrite
of the common template. Note that Gentoo does not have this limitation.
